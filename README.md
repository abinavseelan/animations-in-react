# Animations in React

This is a companion repository for the talk "Animations in React". The talk focused on [react-motion](https://github.com/chenglou/react-motion/) and how it can make making animations a lot easier.

The slides for the talk can be found here: https://slides.com/abinavseelan/animations-in-react

The talk was given at [ReactJS Bangalore Meetup 34](https://www.meetup.com/ReactJS-Bangalore/events/250179465/)
